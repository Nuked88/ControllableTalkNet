After spending my final day thinking through my options, I decided to stick with what I'd chosen the previous day.I'd use Rapid Recovery and Limitless Growth to improve my fundamental abilities. Martial Arts would sharpen my movements. Spell Weaver and Total Affinity would greatly increase the tools at my disposal, and my D-Rank skill would be my ace in the hole.  Pre-Lugh Protagonist, on choosing his skills before reincarnation.
That's a lot to take in, isn't it? With the ‘1-in-1-quintillion' blessing the goddess gives him, our protagonist uses it to kick-start his life's plan. And so, from the outset, we're jumping into an isekai starring an overpowered protagonist. Hopefully, we'll find excitement and wonder in Lugh's journey to do one thing – kill the hero.

The World's Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in Another World as an Aristocrat, Vol. 1 is the first entry to the fantasy-isekai series where nobles cast magic, assassins are employed by royalty, and cosmetics rule (not really). The protagonist, Lugh Tuatha Dé is a world-class assassin reincarnated after his employers decided to ‘conclude his duties'. With his new life, Lugh decides to live for himself. But in return for this opportunity, the goddess tasks him with killing a hero gone rogue 18-years in the future. What does living as a Tuatha Dé entail? What interesting characters will Lugh meet? Where will his adventures take him? And just who is this mysterious hero? Rui Tsukiyo tells a tale of magic, business, and growing up in a world of sword and sorcery. Reia then amplifies the cool and the cute with their expressive and fantastical illustrations.

Hey! It's been a while since my last debut review. So, what do you think? This series certainly wears its premise proudly as the title, and I always appreciate the honesty. I had acquired this one up among others as a curiosity pick – perhaps thinking the flashy cover implied excitement. Well, let me start by saying that's not the case. But before we jump into this review, I want to make a few statements. Firstly, my record with isekai is not great; Reincarnated as a Sword and The Dirty Way to Defeat the Goddess's Heroes failed to impress. So, I was hoping The World's Finest Assassin would fix that, and it's by a prolific author, no less! Secondly, this (mostly) spoiler-free review covers the usual foundations but includes a technical rant later on. I hope this one's informative as well! And with that, let's jump into this review.
